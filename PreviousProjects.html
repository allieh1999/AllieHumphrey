<h3>Captain of CDC (Cyber Defense Club) Web Team, CDC UNCW (University of North Carolina Wilmington) website editing </h3>

<h4>Fall 2022 â€“ May 2023 </h4>
<p>I was assigned as captain of teh web team. The web team's mission was to <br>
make updates to the site involving the rosters, captains, information involving the captains as well as<br>
resizing and editing images of the current leaders of that year.<br>
To do this, the team gained access to their html code. As well as resized the images using adobe photoshop.<br>
The HTML code was used to update the text of the names of the leaders as well as the information needed.<br>
In that process, we also edited and updated the logos (social media contact) that was used, simply by using<br>
logo images.</p><br>
	

<h3>Bananas Project: Human-Computer Interfaces </h3>
<h4>Spring 2022</h4> 
<p>This was a team assigment involving the usage of mobile phone applications to order your groceries in advanced.<br>
This class assignment was used in Human-Computer Interfaces under Dr. Ebrahimi. Instead of producing the actual site,<br>
we used what is called a mid-level test. This mid level test is basically a 3-d image involving what the product could look like.<br>
Mid Level testing can also have some functionality to where you can select some buttons and produce the result of the selection.<br>
In our case, it was choosing the food and beverage items. Going through the cart transaction like users would do when ordering food<br>
pay the item and pick it up from the store (king of like a pre-order for curbside pickup or in store pick up.<br></p>

<h3>Coloring Trash Can Adobe Photoshop: Digital Media </h3>

<h4>Summer 2021 </h4>
<p>When taking the online summer class, I was assigned to work on an Adobe Photoshop project.<br>
For my task, I used a trash can. My mission was to change the color top of the trash can as well as the trash can itself.<br>
To do this, I would use Adobe Photoshop with its color palletes to change the top of the trash can pink and the trash can itself green.</p>
